scripts

Some useful scripts I use on Unix and Linux

eclipse-mirror
--------------
Create an eclipse mirror based on P2.
The path to eclispe has to be replaced.


multipick
---------
The multipick scripts allows to cherry-pick a number of commits in a Git repository
while keeping the source commit information from the -x option of cherry-pick.
Therefore it is possible to cherry-pick a set of commits sharing a common mark.
If one of these commits has been picked before, it will not be picked again.
